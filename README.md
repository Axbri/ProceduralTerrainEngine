# Procedural Terrain Engine

This is my procedural terrain generation experiments in C++ and OpenGL. To goal with this project it to learn about procedural methods for generating terrains and textures. But also to implement most of the things that my Java based 3D graphics engine is capable of in C++. Hopefully this will end up being an interesting looking 3D world where the user/player can walk infinitely in the same direction without reaching the end.
